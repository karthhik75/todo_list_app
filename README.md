The To-Do List App is a Python-based console application that allows users to manage their daily tasks. Users can add new tasks, view the current list of tasks, remove tasks by their index, and persist the task list to a text file (tasks.txt) for future sessions.

Features
View Tasks: Displays a numbered list of all tasks.
Add Task: Allows users to add a new task to the list.
Remove Task: Allows users to remove a task from the list by specifying its number.
Persistent Data: The list of tasks is saved in a file (tasks.txt) and loaded automatically when the application starts.
